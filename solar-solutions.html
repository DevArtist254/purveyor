        Our one single mission: To make Solar Power more accessible to more
        people. To maximise your cost savings, and eventually, your profits,
        from solar power, it’s essential that your system makes use of the best
        quality components and engineering; never compromising on the highest
        output possible. Purveyor offers you comprehensive solutions in terms
        most relevant to you: your return on investment. Our customised systems
        offer you the perfect combination of performance, durability and
        reliability.

        Solar water heating is a simple process. Water is heated by the sun
        while it goes through a solar panel or collector and then is stored in a
        tank. The process is repeated over and over and every time, higher
        temperatures are achieved. Differently from an instant boiler, high
        temperatures are achieved progressively. It’s a slower process and
        that’s why a storage tank where the water can be kept and sent back to
        the solar collector to get heated again is necessary.

        Solar tanks are obviously insulated to make sure that what’s achieved is
        maintained in time and energy loss is kept to the minimum. Storages are
        crucial and need accurate sizing done by professionals.

        Solar energy’s nature is to be variable. Our unique technology creates
        constant pressure for the reverse osmosis purification process, even
        when it’s cloudy. Our system maximizes water production with optimal
        flow rate throughout the day. It enables you to make high-quality
        drinking water with solar power without any energy storage. All units
        can also be used with a hybrid power source.
